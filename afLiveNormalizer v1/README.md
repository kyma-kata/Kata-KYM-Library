# About

This Sound atempts to boost the level of your incoming signal as much as possible without exceeding the headroom setting.
The goal is to have a good level set automatically without changing the dynamic range like a compressor would do.

It's kinda rough so don't expect it to be very accurate.

I made it for easy control of Kyma's AudioInputs. Just slap this on and don't worry too much about setting gain.
