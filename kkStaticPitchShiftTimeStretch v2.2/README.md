# About

This Sound applies time stretching/compress and pitch shift to its input. 

The Sound uses a granular approach to allowing you to change the rate of playback or pitch independently. 

This is similar to the KkLiveTimeStretchPitchShift but works on a static, pre-recorded buffer or sample file.
