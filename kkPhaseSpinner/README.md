# Phase Spinner

Can be used to create signals at a ratio of the Input signal pitch. Can be used to add sub-oscillators or higher harmonics. 
 
Three signals are created with independent tuning ratios and levels.

This Sound takes a Hilbert transform of the Input, calculates the rate of change of the combined phase, and then re-integrates that at a user defined ratio. 

This can sound like a pitch shifter or octaver but isn't granular, a single-sideband ring modulator nor clock-divider, so has its own unique sound.
