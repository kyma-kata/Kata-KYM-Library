# About

This module is a multitap delay with indepedently adjustable taps and one extra adjustable tap for feedback only. If Interpolation is enabled the taps are interpolated such that delays of part samples should work. Delay variations are not smoothed so that clicks will appear while the taps are being altered.

This Sound can be used to produce the Early Reflections in a reverb system.

This Sound is a reimplimentation of the MultiTapDelay found in PetesDSPModules from the Capybara.
